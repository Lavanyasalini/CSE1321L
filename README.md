# CSE1321L
Programming 1 Lab - C++ (Summer 2023)


CSE1321L documents can all be found in https://ccse.kennesaw.edu/fye/1321l/index.php. 

The schedule, the syllubus, and additional resources can be found here as well. 

Submition guidelines: 

For each lab program you develop, make sure to include the following “header” - replace the dots with
your section #, semester, your full name, your instructor’s name, and lab #:

/*

Class: CSE 1321L

Section: ...

Term: ...

Instructor: ...

Name: ...

Lab#: ...

*/

Note: putting *anything* between a /* and */ (“slash star and star slash”) in most languages makes it a
“comment” – which is ignored by the computer. For all your future labs and assignments, you are required
to put the header so we know who submitted the file. Thank you ahead of time!


Title of the lab Rules: 

The title of a lab must follow this format: **Lab 1A.cpp**
